# UnderstandingLLMs

This graduate seminar explores the theoretical foundations, architectures, capabilities, limitations, evaluation methodologies, and research directions of Large Language Models (LLMs). Students will develop a comprehensive understanding of how LLMs work conceptually, learn to critically evaluate their performance, and develop the skills necessary to conduct research in the field. The course emphasizes theoretical understanding supplemented with illustrative code examples and demonstrations, without requiring extensive computational resources.
